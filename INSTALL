QUICK MAKE

If all things are ready, distribution untarred, and you have flex
and bison installed on your system, you should be able to make
argus-clients by simply typing:

   % ./configure
   % make

If you have any problems with this procedure, read further, if not
congratulations.  You can proceed to INSTALLATION.


DEPENDENCIES

The Argus client package is dependant on two public domain packages;
flex and bison().  Both of these packages must be installed in order
to compile argus-clients.

The official site for flex is:
http://www.gnu.org/software/flex

The official site for bison is:
http://www.gnu.org/software/bison


Because Argus is dependant on flex and bison, you will
need to have installed it prior to building the Argus client
software.  Please refer to the individual packages for installation
instructions.

Some argi require cryptographic authentication in order to access
it report access port.  Argus clients can be compiled to support
this strong authentication strategy by compiling with ARGUS_SASL
support and linking to the cryptographic package SASL, the
Simple Authentication and Security Layer, which provides strong
authentication and wireline confidentiality for argus data.  Because
of its features and flexibility, we highly recommend using SASL,
and becoming experienced with its administration.

CONFIGURE

The program, ./configure, will scan the file system, looking for
the flex and bison and make some assumptions about the platform which
will allow ./configure to choose between gcc, acc, and cc.  There
really isn't anything else to it.


BUILDING ARGUS-CLIENTS
So, after all that, to build Argus on a supported platform, first run
./configure.  ./configure will determine your system attributes and
generate subdirectories and the appropriate Makefiles from the Makefile.in
files found in the distribution.  After running ./configure, run "make".
If everything goes well, appropriate libraries and binaries will be found
in the ./bin and ./lib subdirectories.  So, ....

   % ./configure
   % make

The argus clients will be found as ./bin/ra*.

So, at this point you should have all the execuables needed.  But,
if you are having problems, it may be related to your compiler or
the flex and bison utilities.  So, ...

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build argus.  If your compiler
is not ANSI compliant, we highly recommend using the GNU C compiler,
available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-*.tar.gz


Argus requires bison and flex.  For flex, version 2.4.6 or higher
is recommended.  The current version of flex and bison are available
via anonymous ftp:

        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/bison-*.tar.gz
        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/non-gnu/flex/flex-*.tar.gz


Now, if you are still having problems, ..., well its hard to say
from here what it might be.  So, you may want to send us some
mail.



INSTALLATION

QUICK INSTALL

If all things are well at this point, and you will be using
the installation strategy that we use, all you need do now
is:

   # make install

This will install the argus-client executables into 
/usr/local/bin, by default, man pages into /usr/local/man
and documenation into /usr/share/doc.

If you are unsure about the standard installtion, run

   % make -n install

to review what make will try to do.  If you would like to
do something other than the standard install, then please
continue to read through this file.


Argus-clients do not have any installation retrictions, so you
can install them anywhere.  There are some conventions that have
been established, and I'll present them here, but you can, of
course, do your own thing.

I have found it useful to have an argus home directory to hold
the binaries, client configuration files, and hold my argus data
archive.  If you would like to use this strategy, create your
directory, and create the environment variable ARGUSHOME and set
it to this directory.

I use /usr/argus.  I prefer putting the ra* client binaries in
/usr/argus/bin.  When associated with a argus distribution,
the argus in my scheme is in /usr/argus/sbin.

After making, as root, I just:

   # mkdir /usr/argus /usr/argus/bin
   # cp bin/ra* /usr/argus/bin
   # cp bin/argusbug /usr/argus/bin

Argus-clients have a rc style configuration strategy, to set things
like the output date format, what columns to print out etc .. 
You can have a system wide configuration file that would reside
as /etc/ra.conf.  Clients will look here by default for its base
configuration, and then look for a .rarc file in your home directory.
So you don't have to have a system wide configuration file, unless
you prefer it.

   # cp ./support/Config/ra.conf /etc/ra.conf

You will want to edit this file to choose values of your
liking.  The sample has all the common values set and is
a good suggestion.  Please refer to the sample to make your
personal changes.


Copying the man and doc directories is nice.
   
   # tar cf - doc man | (cd /usr/argus; tar xvpf -)


This should handle the basic installion.

Any comments, patches, bug reports or additions should be sent to 
argus@qosient.com.



PORTABILITY

Argus-clients have been developed on Sparc architectures under SunOS 4.1.x
and Solaris 2.7, and have been successfully ported to Solaris, SGI, Ultrix,
Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD platforms, as well as Cygwin.
 
No claim is made as to the portability of argus-clients to other platforms,
although it is much easier now that we've addressed the big endian little
endian issues.  If you make any modifications to support installing and
running argus-clients in any other environment, please send us comments
and/or patches.  We will be most grateful.
