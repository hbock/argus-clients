This directory contains source code for programs that read, parse
and process Argus data, and comprise the client part of the Audit Record
Generation and Utilization System.  Argus is an IP network transaction
auditing tool,  that generates a persistent audit of all network
transactions and their performance.  The data that Argus generates
can be used for a wide range of tasks including Network Operations,
Security, Assurance and Performance Management.

To install the software and get started, see the ./INSTALL file.
For answers to many questions, please see the ./docs/FAQ file.

Argus 3.0 clients are capable of process argus-1.7, 1.8, 2.0,
and argus-3.0 data, as well as Cisco Netflow data. 

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the Argus mailing list
email address, "argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu".

************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing
list at argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus. Argusbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.
