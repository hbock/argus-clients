<B>rasplit</B> - split <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+argus">argus</A>(8)</B> data.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>rasplit</B>

[[<B>-M</B> <I>splitmode</I>] [<I>splitmode options</I>]]
[<B>raoptions</B>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAB"></A>
<P>

<B>Rasplit</B> reads
<B>argus</B>

data from an <I>argus-data</I> source, and splits the resulting
output into consecutive sections of records based on size, count
time, or flow event, writing the output into a set of output-files.
By default, <B>rasplit</B> puts 10,000 records of input into each 
<B>argus</B> output file, or standard out.
<P>
The output files' name consists of a prefix, which is specified using
the <I>-w</I> <I>ra option</I>, and a suffix, which is created for each
resulting file.  If no prefix is provided, then <B>rasplit</B> will
use 'x' as the default prefix.  The suffix that is used is determined
by the mode of operation.  When <B>rasplit</B> is using the default
count mode or the size mode, the suffix is a group of letters &quot;aa&quot;,
&quot;ab&quot;, and so on, such that concatenating the output files in sorted
order by file name produces the original input file.  If <B>rasplit</B>
will need to create more output files than are allowed by the default
suffix strategy, more letters will be added, in order to accomodate
the needed files.  When the mode is <B>time</B> mode, the default
output filename suffix is '%Y.%m.%d.%h.%m.%s', which is used by
strftime() to create an output filename that is time oriented.
This default is overrided by adding a '%' extension to the name
provided on the commandline using the <I>-w</I> option.
<P>
When standard out is specified, using <I>-w -</I>, <B>rasplit</B>
will output a single <B>argus-stream</B> with START and STOP argus management
records inserted appropriately to indicate where the output is split.
See <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+argus">argus</A>(8)</B> for more information on output stream formats.
<P>
When <B>rasplit</B> is spliting on output record count (the default), the
number of records is specified as an ordinal counter, the default is
10,000 records.  When <B>rasplit</B> is spliting based on the maximum output
file size, the size is specified as bytes.  The scale of the bytes can be
specified by appending 'b', 'k' and 'm' to the number provided.
<P>
When <B>rasplit</B> is spliting based on time, the time period is specified
with the option, and can be any period based in seconds (s), minutes (m),
hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), months (M) or years (y).  <B>Rasplit</B>
will create and modify records as required to split on prescribed time
boundaries.  If any record spans a time boundary, the record is split
and the metrics are adjusted using a uniform distribution model to
distribute the statistics between the two records.  Care is taken to
avoid records with zero packet and byte counts, that could result
from roundoff error.
<P>
When <B>rasplit</B> is spliting based on flow event, the flow that acts
as the event marker is specified using a standard <B>ra</B> filter
expression, that is bounded by quotes (&quot;).  Records that preceed the
first flow event in the data stream are written to the specified
output file, and then new files are generated with the flow event
record being the first record of the new file.  This method will allow
you to use wire events as triggers for spliting data.

<H2>RASPLIT SPECIFIC OPTIONS</H2>

Rasplit, like all ra based clients, supports
a number of <B>ra options</B> including remote data access, reading
from multiple files and filtering of input argus records through a
terminating filter expression. 
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+rasplit">rasplit</A>(1)</B> specific options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B><I> suffix length</I>

<DD>
default is 2 characters.
<DT><B>-M</B><I> splitmode</I>

<DD>
Supported spliting modes are:
<PRE>
   <B>    count &lt;num&gt;</B>
   <B>     size &lt;size&gt;</B>
   <B>     time &lt;period&gt;</B>
   <B>     flow &quot;filter-expression&quot;</B>
</PRE>

<DT><B>-w</B><I> filename</I>

<DD>
<B>Rasplit</B> supports an extended <I>-w</I> option that allows for
output record contents to be inserted into the output filename.
Specified using '$' (dollar) notation, any printable field can be used.
Care should be taken to honor any shell escape requirements when
specifying on the command line.  See <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ra">ra</A>(1)</B> for the list of
printable fields.
<P>
Another extended feature, when using <B>time</B> mode, <B>rasplit</B>
will process the supplied filename using <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+strftime">strftime</A>(3)</B>, so that
time fields can be inserted into the resulting output filename.
<P>

<H2>INVOCATION</H2>

This invocation reads <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+argus">argus</A>(8)</B> data from <B>inputfile</B> and splits
the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+argus">argus</A>(8)</B> data stream based on output file size of no greater
than 1 Megabyte.  The resulting output files have a prefix of <I>argus.</I>
and suffix that starts with 'aa'.  The single trailing '.' is significant.
<PRE>
 
   <B>rasplit</B> -r inputfile -M size 1m -w argus.
 
</PRE>

<P>
This invocation splits <B>inputfile</B> based on hard 10 minute time boundaries.
The resulting output files are created with a prefix of <I>/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus.</I>
and the suffix is <I>%H.%M.%S</I>.  The values will be supplied based on the time in
the record being written out.
<PRE>
  
   <B>rasplit</B> -r * -M time 10m -w &quot;/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus.%H.%M.%S&quot;
 
</PRE>

<P>
This invocation splits <B>inputfile</B> based on the argus source identifier.
The resulting output files are created with a prefix of <I>/archive/Source Identifier/argus.</I>
and the default suffix starting with  &quot;aa&quot;.  The source identifier will be
supplied based on the contents of the record being exported.
<PRE>
  
   <B>rasplit</B> -r * -M time 10m -w &quot;/archive/$srcid/argus.&quot;
 
</PRE>

This invocation splits <B>inputfile</B> based on a flow event marker.
The resulting output files are created with a prefix of 'outfile.' and
the default suffix starting with  &quot;aa&quot;.  Whenever a ping to a specific
host is seen in the stream, a new output file is generated.
<PRE>
  
   <B>rasplit</B> -r * -M flow &quot;echo and host 1.2.3.4&quot; -w outfile.
